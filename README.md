# OSINT Based ATT&CK Maps

This is the start of tracking a project I've been doing for a few weeks now so some of the older entries will be cited slightly differently, but I provide the means to find the original research that fed into the map. These are either newly created ATT&CK maps or updates to existing MITRE maps based on new intelligence.
